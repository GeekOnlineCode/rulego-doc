## Basic Concepts

RuleGo AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) mechanism ï¼Œwhich is similar to interceptor or hook mechanism, but more powerful and flexible.
- It allows adding extra behavior to the rule chain execution without modifying the original logic of the rule chain or nodes.
- It allows separating some common behaviors (such as logging, security, rule chain execution tracking, component degradation, component retry, component caching) from the business logic.

AOP terminology:

- **Pointcut:** is the object to be intercepted, the framework provides a method to determine whether to intercept the object. For example: specify some component types or relationType to execute the aspect logic;return ctx.Self().Type()=="mqttClient".
- **Advice:** also known as enhancement point, is the extra logic code inserted at the pointcut position, the framework currently provides the following types of advice:
  - Node before advice (Before Advice): executes before the node OnMsg method.
  - Node after advice (After Advice): executes after the node OnMsg method.
  - Node Around advice (Around Advice): executes before and after the node OnMsg method. This type of advice can replace the original node logic. It can implement node failover, retry, caching and other functions.
  - Start advice (Start Advice): executes before the rule engine OnMsg method. It can be used to initialize some data.
  - End advice (End Advice): executes after the rule engine OnMsg method and the branch chain execution ends.
  - Completed advice (Completed Advice): executes after the rule engine OnMsg method and all branch chain execution ends.
  - OnCreated advice (OnCreated Advice): executes after the rule engine is successfully created.
  - OnReload advice (OnReload Advice): executes after the rule engine reloads the rule chain or node configuration.
  - OnDestroy advice (OnDestroy Advice): executes after the rule engine instance is destroyed.
- **Aspect:** is the collection of pointcuts and advice. For example: [Debug Aspect](/en/pages/ead9b2/) It implements Before Advice and After Advice.
  - The framework has some built-in aspects, such as: [Debug Aspect](/en/pages/ead9b2/), [Fallback Aspect](/en/pages/78e359/).
  - You can customize the aspect.
## Usage

The following is an example of a debug log aspect implementation that intercepts the component execution situation:

```go
import (
"github.com/rulego/rulego/api/types"
)

var (
  // Compile-time check Debug implements types.BeforeAspect.
  _ types.BeforeAspect = (*Debug)(nil)
  // Compile-time check Debug implements types.AfterAspect.
  _ types.AfterAspect = (*Debug)(nil)
)

// Debug node debug log aspect
type Debug struct {
}

//The smaller the value, the higher the execution priority
func (aspect *Debug) Order() int {
    return 900
}

// PointCut pointcut all nodes will execute
func (aspect *Debug) PointCut(ctx types.RuleContext, msg types.RuleMsg, relationType string) bool {
    return true
}

func (aspect *Debug) Before(ctx types.RuleContext, msg types.RuleMsg, relationType string) types.RuleMsg {
    //Asynchronously record In log
	aspect.onDebug(ctx, types.In, msg, relationType, nil)
    return msg
}

func (aspect *Debug) After(ctx types.RuleContext, msg types.RuleMsg, err error, relationType string) types.RuleMsg {
    //Asynchronously record Out log
    aspect.onDebug(ctx, types.Out, msg, relationType, err)
    return msg
}

func (aspect *Debug) onDebug(ctx types.RuleContext, flowType string, msg types.RuleMsg, relationType string, err error) {
  ctx.SubmitTack(func () {
    //Asynchronously record log
    if ctx.Self() != nil && ctx.Self().IsDebugMode() {
    var chainId = ""
    if ctx.RuleChain() != nil {
    chainId = ctx.RuleChain().GetNodeId().Id
    }
    ctx.Config().OnDebug(chainId, flowType, ctx.Self().GetNodeId().Id, msg.Copy(), relationType, err)
    }
  })
}

```
:::tip It is recommended to add protection checks to prevent interface changes that can be detected at compile time. For example:
```go
var (
_ types.BeforeAspect = (*Debug)(nil)
_ types.AfterAspect = (*Debug)(nil)
)
```
:::

Then register the log aspect in create RuleEngine:

```go
ruleEngine, err := rulego.New(chainId, ruleFile, types.WithAspects(&Debug{}))
```
