OnCreated Advice: Executed after the rule engine is successfully created.

## Interface

```go
// Order returns the execution order, the smaller the value, the higher the priority
Order() int
// PointCut declares a cut point, used to determine whether to execute the advice
// For example: specify some component types or relationType to execute the aspect logic; return ctx.Self().Type()=="mqttClient"
PointCut(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg, relationType string) bool
// OnCreated is the advice after the rule engine is successfully created
OnCreated(chainCtx NodeCtx)
```
