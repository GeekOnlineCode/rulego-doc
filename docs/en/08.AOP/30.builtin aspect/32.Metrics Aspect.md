Metrics Aspect: Metrics Aspect for statistical analysis. The rule engine instance statistics for the following metrics:
- Current: The number of processes currently being handled by the rule engine
- Total: The total number of processes completed by the rule engine
- Failed: The total number of rule branch chains that failed to execute in the rule engine
- Success: The total number of rule branch chains that successfully executed in the rule engine

To obtain the metrics data of the rule engine, use the following method:
```go
ruleEngine, ok := rulego.Get("rule01")
metrics := ruleEngine.GetMetrics()
if metrics != nil {
    fmt.Println(metrics)
}
```
Reset the metrics data:
```go
ruleEngine, ok := rulego.Get("rule01")
metrics := ruleEngine.GetMetrics()
if metrics != nil {
    metrics.Reset()
}
```
