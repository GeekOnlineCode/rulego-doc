Node before advice (Before Advice): executes before the node OnMsg method.

Before, After, Around Advice execution order: Around->Before->Around

## Interface

```go
// Order returns the execution order, the smaller the value, the higher the priority
Order() int
// New creates a new instance
New() Aspect
// PointCut declares a cut-in point, used to determine whether to execute the advice
//For example: specify some component types or relationType to execute the aspect logic;return ctx.Self().Type()=="mqttClient"
PointCut(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg, relationType string) bool
// Before is the advice that executes before the node OnMsg method. The returned Msg will be used as the input for the next advice and the node OnMsg method.
Before(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg, relationType string) RuleMsg
```
