Completed Advice: Executed after executing the rule engine OnMsg method and completing all chain executions.

## Interface

```go
// Order returns the execution order, the smaller the value, the higher the priority
Order() int
// New creates a new instance
New() Aspect
// PointCut declares a cut point, used to determine whether to execute the advice
// For example: specify some component types or relationType to execute the aspect logic; return ctx.Self().Type()=="mqttClient"
PointCut(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg, relationType string) bool
// Completed is the advice after the rule engine OnMsg method is executed and all branch chains are finished. The returned Msg will be used as the input parameter for the next advice.
Completed(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg) RuleMsg
```
