You can encapsulate your business logic or common tools into components, and then call them in the rule chain by configuring the rule nodes.

## Custom Components

### Component Interface

Implement the [types.Node](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/blob/main/api/types/types.go) interface:

```go
// Node is the rule engine node component interface
// Encapsulate the business or common logic into components, and then call the component through the rule chain configuration method
// The implementation method refers to the `components` package
// Then register to the `RuleGo` default registrar
// rulego.Registry.Register(&MyNode{})
type Node interface {
// New creates a new component instance
// A new instance will be created for each rule node in the rule chain, and the data is independent
New() Node
// Type is the component type, which cannot be repeated.
// Used for rule chain, node.type configuration, initialize the corresponding component
// It is recommended to use `/` to distinguish the namespace and prevent conflicts. For example: x/httpClient
Type() string
// Init is the component initialization, usually do some component parameter configuration or client initialization operations
// The rule node in the rule chain will call it once during initialization
Init(ruleConfig Config, configuration Configuration) error
// OnMsg handles messages, each data flowing into the component will be processed by this function
// ctx: rule engine message processing context
// msg: message
OnMsg(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg)
// Destroy is used to destroy the component, do some resource release operations
Destroy()
}
```

### Life Cycle

- **New:** Called when creating a node component instance.
- **Init:** Used to parse the JSON configuration of the current node, initialized once when initializing the rule chain.
- **OnMsg:** Used to handle messages, each data flowing into the node component will be processed by this function.
- **Destroy:** Called when the node is destroyed. This method is called when the rule engine is destroyed, or when the rule chain or node configuration is updated.
> If the node configuration is dynamically updated, the `Init` method of the new instance of the node is called first. If the initialization is successful, the `Destroy` method of the old instance is called.

### Handle Messages

The rule node implementation uses the following methods to notify the rule engine that it has successfully processed the message:
```go
// TellSuccess notifies the rule engine that the current message has been processed successfully,
// And send the message to the next node through the `Success` relationship
TellSuccess(msg RuleMsg)
// TellNext uses the specified relationTypes to send messages to the next node
TellNext(msg RuleMsg, relationTypes ...string)
```

If the message processing fails, the rule node implementation must call the `tellFailure` method:
```go
// TellFailure notifies the rule engine that the current message processing failed,
// And send the message to the next node through the `Failure` relationship
TellFailure(msg RuleMsg, err error)
```

### Example

Implement the Node interface, define the component:

```go
// UpperNode is a plugin that converts the message data to uppercase
type UpperNode struct{}

func (n *UpperNode) Type() string {
   return "test/upper"
}
func (n *UpperNode) New() types.Node {
  return &UpperNode{}
}
func (n *UpperNode) Init(ruleConfig types.Config, configuration types.Configuration) error {
  // Do some initialization work
  return nil
}
// Handle messages
func (n *UpperNode) OnMsg(ctx types.RuleContext, msg types.RuleMsg)  {
  msg.Data = strings.ToUpper(msg.Data)
  // Send the modified message to the next node
  ctx.TellSuccess(msg)
}

func (n *UpperNode) Destroy() {
// Do some cleanup work
}
```

Register to the rulego default registrar
```go
rulego.Registry.Register(&MyNode{})
```

Then use your custom component in the rule chain file:

``` json
{
  "ruleChain": {
    "name": "Test Rule Chain",
    "root": true,
    "debugMode": false
  },
  "metadata": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "s1",
        "type": "test/upper",
        "name": "Name",
        "debugMode": true,
        "configuration": {
          "field1": "Component-defined configuration parameters",
          "....": "..."
        }
      }
    ],
    "connections": [
      {
        "fromId": "s1",
        "toId": "Connect to the next component ID",
        "type": "The connection relationship with the component"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## `go plugin` method to provide components

This method supports dynamic loading of components, but it can only support non-windows systems.

Implement the [types.PluginRegistry](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/blob/main/api/types/types.go) interface.
And export the variable name: `Plugins`, refer to [examples/plugin](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/tree/main/examples/plugin)

### Example
Implement the [types.PluginRegistry](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/blob/main/api/types/types.go) interface

```go
// Export the plugin variable
var Plugins MyPlugins

type MyPlugins struct{}

func (p *MyPlugins) Init() error {
    return nil
}
func (p *MyPlugins) Components() []types.Node {
  // A plugin can provide multiple components
  return []types.Node{&UpperNode{}, &TimeNode{}, &FilterNode{}}
}
```

Compile the plugin:
``` shell
# Compile the plugin, generate the plugin.so file, you need to compile it in a mac or linux environment
go build -buildmode=plugin -o plugin.so plugin.go
```

Register to the rulego default registrar:
```go
rulego.Registry.RegisterPlugin("test", "./plugin.so")
```

## Contribute Components

The core feature of RuleGo is componentization, and all business logic is components, and they can be flexibly configured and reused. At present, RuleGo has built-in a lot of common components.
However, we know that these components are far from meeting the needs of all users, so we hope that more developers can contribute extension components to RuleGo, making RuleGo's ecology more rich and powerful.

> If the component code you submit does not have third-party dependencies or is a general-purpose component, please submit it to the standard component [components](https://github.com/rulego/rulego) under the main library,
> Otherwise, submit it to the extension component repository: [rulego-components](https://github.com/rulego/rulego-components).
