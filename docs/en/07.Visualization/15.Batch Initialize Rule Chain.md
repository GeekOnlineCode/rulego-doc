You can specify a folder path, load all rule chain configuration files with the suffix `.json`, and initialize the corresponding rule engine instances to the rule engine instance pool. Example:

```go
config := rulego.NewConfig()
err := rulego.Load("./chains/", rulego.WithConfig(config))
```

::: danger Warning:
Each rule chain file needs to specify an Id, and ensure its uniqueness. For example:
```json
{
  "ruleChain": {
    "id": "chain_call_rest_api",
    ...
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```
:::

Then get the rule chain instance by the rule chain ID:
```go
ruleEngine, ok := rulego.Get("chain_call_rest_api")
```
