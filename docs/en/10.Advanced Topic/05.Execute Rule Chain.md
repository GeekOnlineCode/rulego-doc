### Asynchronous Execution of Rule Chain

Does not block the parent process. You can listen for the end through `types.WithOnEnd` or `types.WithOnAllNodeCompleted`. The usage is as follows:
```go
ruleEngine, ok := rulego.Get("rule-01")
ruleEngine.OnMsg(msg, opts ...types.RuleContextOption)
```

### Synchronous Execution of Rule Chain

Blocks the parent process, and will not proceed until all nodes of the rule chain have completed execution. The usage is as follows:
```go
ruleEngine, ok := rulego.Get("rule-01")
ruleEngine.OnMsgAndWait(msg, opts ...types.RuleContextOption)
```
This meets the use case where it is necessary to return to the parent process. If this scenario is not required, use the asynchronous call method.

### RuleContextOption
