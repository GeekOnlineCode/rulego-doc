### Asynchronous execution of rule chain

Do not block the parent process, listen for the end through OnEnd. Usage:
```go
ruleEngine.OnMsg(msg, types.WithEndFunc(func(ctx types.RuleContext,msg types.RuleMsg, err error) {
	
})
```

### Synchronous execution of rule chain

Block the parent process, wait for all nodes in the rule chain to execute before proceeding. This meets the usage scenario where you need to return to the parent process. If you do not need this scenario, use the asynchronous invocation method. Usage:
```go
ruleEngine.OnMsgAndWait(msg, types.WithEndFunc(func(ctx types.RuleContext,msg types.RuleMsg, err error) {
	
})
```
